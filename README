Device-Quasar3108 version 0.01
==============================

Device::Quasar3108 is a perl module for controlling 
Quasar Electronics kit number 3108 (Serial Isolated I/O module).
The kit has eight relays and four opto-isolated inputs.

It seems very similar (identical?) to Carl's Electronic Kits 
number CK1610:
